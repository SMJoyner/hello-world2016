Practice repository

Hello World!

I'm Shana. I develop apps for all things Apple and I also create eBooks (iBooks, Kindle, Nook).
It's been a few years since I made use of GitHub and I don't know why. 
I'm getting reacquainted so I can push some of my "vintage" iPhone practice code from local repositories.
Updated versions and newer code snippets for both Objective-C and Swift are in the works to get pushed.
My production code for live apps remains private and local of course.
